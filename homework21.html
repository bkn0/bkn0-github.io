<h1>Patrick Young</h1>
I am a lecture in the Stanford Computer Science Department. Before coming to Stanford, I spent two years as a<br>
programmer at Taligent(now part of IBM). At Taligent, I work on places for Project Teams, a groupware product<br>
designed to improve communication and coordination within small project teams. I was fortunate to work with the Places for<br>
Project Teams product throughout an entire software lifecycle--from initial product conception through the actual product<br>
lunch.<p>
I have a Ph.D. from the University California, Irvine, where I specialized in Software Engineering. My dissertaion was on<br>
process support for software engineering teams. I also have a msters degree from Irvine, with a specialization in Artificial<br>
Intelligence, and bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Enginerering.<p>
At Irvine, I taught Introduction to Software Engineering, a sophomore core class, and Software Processes, a graduate<br>
seminar. I also worked as a peer academic advisor, a freshmen orientaion advisor, and served on leadership for campus<br>
chapters of both Habitat for Humanity and InterVarsity Christian Fellowship.<p>
<p>In My spare time, I participate in a variety of activies including:</p>

● Classical Guitar<br>
● <ins style="color:blue;">Freestyle Figure Skating</ins><br>
● Keeping Molly, my 
<ins style="color:blue;">Cairn Terrier</ins>
, out of trouble.<br>
