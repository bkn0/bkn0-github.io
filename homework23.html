         Professor Richard Zare in his lab. Whether it's the summer 
         grass that tickles your feet or the red Bordeaux smacking on your 
         palate, nearly every part of the world around your carris
          special chemical makers. These markers, called isotopes, can 
          tell scientists where the molecules that compose a substance 
          are from, where they traveled and what happended to them 
          along the way. But doing these analyes has been comples 
          and costly. Now, Stanford chemists have developed a new 
          method to make isotopic analysis easier and less expensive.

     standford is an epicenter for the vintage dance movement--but 
     life in the Stanford dance world is not all foxtrots and tangos. 
     The June 26-28 Stanford's Dance Weekend in Roble Gym 
     offers something for modern dance enthusiasts, too: the 
     hustle, the West Coast swing, 1970s disco hustle, Bollywood 
     and blues fusion.
